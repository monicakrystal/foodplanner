/* 

To do:
    - should I make my own from scratch? or use a component library?
    - design in figma first
    - needs day, month, and week view
    - add to grocery list button?
    - add recipes to faves, or saves?
    - 
    - calculations show ere

Goal:
    - Allow the user to drag and drop recipes in to plan
    - saves recipes from past and future
    - automatic saves so if something goes wrong its still there
    - copy and paste to other days
    - Automatically calculate and display total nutrition (calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber).

Current Scope:
    - default

Future Improvements:
