Goal:
    - Allow the user to drag and drop recipes into a day plan.
    - Automatically calculate and display total nutrition (calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber).

Current Scope:
    - Focus only on the calculation logic and rendering basic totals.
    - Ignore drag-and-drop and UI polish for now.

Future Improvements: 
    - Add drag-and-drop support to assign recipes to specific days/meals.
    - Improve layout and styling for usability and responsiveness.
    - Show per-meal and per-day breakdowns (e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner).
    - Add the ability to save, edit, and reset daily plans.
